# Attorney Online Background Automator
###### (Unfinished on few departments, however the code is ready to use. May contain bugs.)

An Attorney Online Background Automator, mostly for Danganronpa Online usage due to the AO2.8 update. Created in Python with PyQt5.

Creates a background folder from a single image, automating the entire process of copy, pasting and renaming. 

## Notes

When running the program, you will see a small window pop up. This is the program's interface.

- File: Open Files
  - This will open a directory window. Your task here is to load your image(s) into the program. It supports .PNG, .GIF, .APNG, and .WEBP

- Help: Guide
  - This button contains a link where you will be redirected to a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z8GvJarlIpGeE7jriNIdF2APJns7GnPBY5dqWd9vUI/edit) document on which it will explain how to use the program.
  
- Help: Credits
  - A popup will pop up and show who wrote the program. 
  
- Output
  - This will open a directory window. Your task here is to set your output/export location. By default, it will export in the same directory as the program inside a folder named "background". Please refer to **Known Bugs** for info regarding a bug within this part of the program.
  
- Include TD (Transparent Desks)
  - The point explains it all, it will include a transparent image as the background's desk. There is a bug in Attorney Online where the placeholder desk will show up when they could not find a desk image for it.

- Execute
  - Once you've loaded your image files into the program, this button will become available and start the batch automation process.

### Known Bugs

- Clicking on "Directory" and cancelling afterwards will change the directory to your C:// directory.
